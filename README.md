# Cloudy Notes
Very cloudy notes for Cloud Computing Technologies in Universit√° Statale di Milano

Give us laboratory sessions please!!

To compile the code just head in the directory (./cloudy-notes) and do a run of latexmk like so:
```
$ latexmk main.tex
```
If you find any problems or you want to make additions to the file, please go ahead and open a new issue.

Currently the project is on hold, but if I come around to the exam again this next semester I will get back to it and finish what I started, here is my idea for this repository.

## Important work to do!
 - [ ] Correct all of the chapters in the final document
 - [ ] Update the informations inside the document
 - [x] Standardize the structure of the project making it better and more share-oriented
